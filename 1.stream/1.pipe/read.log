 Nodejs Stream 兼容性:
 As a Stream, process.stdin can also be used in "old" mode that is compatible with scripts written for node.js prior to v0.10.
 For more information see Stream compatibility. see /node-v5.6.0/doc/api/stream.html#stream_compatibility_with_older_node_js_versions
 In "old" Streams mode the stdin stream is paused by default, so one must call process.stdin.resume() to read from it.
 Note also that calling process.stdin.resume() itself would switch stream to "old" mode.
