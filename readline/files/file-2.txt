A stream is an abstract interface implemented by various objects in Node. For example a request to an HTTP server is a stream, as is stdout.Streamsare readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of EventEmitter
You can load the Stream base classes by doing require('stream'). There are base classes provided for Readable streams, Writable streams, Duplex streams, and Transform streams.
This document is split up into 3 sections. The first explains the parts of the API that you need to be aware of to use streams in your programs. If you never implement a streaming API yourself, you can stop there.
The second section explains the parts of the API that you need to use if you implement your own custom streams yourself. The API is designed to make this easy for you to do.
